input consists of multiple "reports" (lists of numbers)
the program has to show how many reports are safe
a report is safe under two conditions:
1 - the numbers are either all increasing or all decreasing
2 - any two adjacent numbers differ by at least one and at most three
Examples:
7 6 4 2 1: Safe
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe
1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe
8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe
1 3 6 7 9: Safe
